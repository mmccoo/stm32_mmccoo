from the datasheet

section 10
All transactions on the SPI interface start with a header byte containing a R/W ̄ bit, a burst access bit (B), and a 6-bit address (A5 – A0).

-----------------------
| R/W | Burst | A5-A0 |
-----------------------


The CSn pin must be kept low during transfers on the SPI bus. If CSn goes high during the transfer of a header byte or during read/write from/to a register,  the transfer will be cancelled.



Max SCLK is 6.5MHz

When CSn is pulled low, the MCU must wait until CC1101 SO pin goes low before starting to transfer the header byte. This indicates that the crystal is running. Unless the chip was in the SLEEP or XOFF states, the SO pin will always go low immediately after taking CSn low.

Table 23
CHIP_RDY - SO pin - Stays high until power and crystal have stabilized. Should always be low when using the SPI interface.

section 10.1

When the header byte, data byte, or command strobe is sent on the SPI interface, the chip status byte is sent by the CC1101 on the SO pin. The status byte contains key status signals, useful for the MCU. The first bit, s7, is the CHIP_RDYn signal and this signal must go low before the first positive edge of SCLK. The CHIP_RDYn signal indicates that the crystal is running.

Bits 6, 5, and 4 comprise the STATE value. This value reflects the state of the chip. The XOSC and power to the digital core are on in the IDLE state, but all other modules are in power down. The frequency and channel configuration should only be updated when the chip is in this state. The RX state will be active when the chip is in receive mode. Likewise, TX is active when the chip is transmitting.

The last four bits (3:0) in the status byte contains FIFO_BYTES_AVAILABLE. For read operations (the R/W ̄ bit in the header byte is set to 1), the FIFO_BYTES_AVAILABLE field contains the number of bytes available for reading from the RX FIFO. For write operations (the R/W ̄ bit in the header byte is set to 0), the FIFO_BYTES_AVAILABLE field contains the number of bytes that can be written to the TX FIFO. When FIFO_BYTES_AVAILABLE=15, 15 or more bytes are available/free


section 10.2
The configuration registers on the CC1101 are located on SPI addresses from 0x00 to 0x2E. Table 43 on page 68 lists all configuration registers.

All configuration registers can be both written to and read. The R/W ̄ bit controls if the register should be written to or read.
When writing to   registers, the status byte is sent on the SO pin each time a header byte or data byte is transmitted on the SI pin.
When reading from registers, the status byte is sent on the SO pin each time a header byte is transmitted on the SI pin.


Registers  with  consecutive  addresses  can  be accessed  in  an  efficient  way  by  setting  the burst  bit (B) in  the  header byte.  The  address bits  (A5 – A0) set the  start  address  in an internal  address  counter.  This  counter  is incremented  by  one  each  new  byte  (every  8 clock  pulses).

The  burst  access  is  either  a read or a write access and must be terminated by setting CSn high.

For  register  addresses  in  the  range  0x30-0x3D,  the  burst bit  is  used  to  select  between status  registers when burst  bit is  one, and between   command  strobes when burst  bit is zero.  See more  in  Section 10.3 below. Because  of  this,  burst  access  is  not  available for status registers and they must be accessed one at a time. The status registers can only be read.

section 10.4
Command  Strobes  may  be  viewed  as  single byte  instructions  to CC1101.  By  addressing  a command  strobe  register,  internal sequences will  be  started.  These  commands  are  used  to disable  the crystal  oscillator,  enable  receive mode,  enable  wake-on-radio  etc.  The 13 command  strobes  are  listed  in Table 42 on page 67.

The  command  strobe  registers  are  accessed by transferring a single header byte (no data is being  transferred). That  is,  only  the R/W  ̄ bit, the  burst  access  bit  (set  to  0),  and  the six  address bits (in the range 0x30 through 0x3D) are  written. The  R/W  ̄ bit  can  be  either  one  or zero and will determine how the FIFO_BYTES_AVAILABLE field  in  the  status byte should be interpreted.

A  command  strobe  may  be  followed  by  any other  SPI  access  without  pulling  CSn  high. However,  if  an SRES strobe  is  being  issued, one  will  have  to  wait  for  SO  to  go  low  again before  the next header  byte can  be  issued  as shown in Figure 16. The command strobes are executed  immediately,  with  the  exception  of the SPWD, SWOR, and  the SXOFF strobes, which are executed when CSn goes high.
